# Exercise 1.10: Even more services

Split the "Log output" application into two different containers within a single pod:

One generates a new timestamp every 5 seconds and saves it into a file.

The other reads that file and outputs it with a hash for the user to see.

Either application can generate the hash. The reader or the writer.

You may find this helpful now since there are more than one container running inside a pod.
