# Exercise 1.01: Getting started

Exercises can be done with any language and framework you want.

Create an application that generates a random string on startup, stores this string into memory, and outputs it every 5 seconds with a timestamp. e.g.

2020-03-30T12:15:17.705Z: 8523ecb1-c716-4cb6-a044-b9e83bb98e43
2020-03-30T12:15:22.705Z: 8523ecb1-c716-4cb6-a044-b9e83bb98e43

Deploy it into your Kubernetes cluster and confirm that it's running with kubectl logs ...

You will keep building this application in the future exercises. This application will be called "Log output".
