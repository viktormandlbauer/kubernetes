# Exercise 1.11: Persisting data

Let's share data between "Ping-pong" and "Log output" applications using persistent volumes. Create both a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim and alter the Deployment to utilize it. As PersistentVolumes are often maintained by cluster administrators rather than developers and those are not application specific you should keep the definition for those separated, perhaps in own folder.

Save the number of requests to "Ping-pong" application into a file in the volume and output it with the timestamp and hash when sending a request to our "Log output" application.
