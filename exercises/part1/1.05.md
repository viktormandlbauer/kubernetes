Exercise 1.05: Project v0.3

Have the project respond something to a GET request sent to the project. A simple html page is good or you can deploy something more complex like a single-page-application.

See here how you can define environment variables for containers.

Use kubectl port-forward to confirm that the project is accessible and works in the cluster by using a browser to access the project.
